        <h1>The Puzzle of the Enchanted Compass</h1>
        <img src="mystery/compass.jpeg" alt="My Image">
        <p>In the quaint hamlet of Puzzleburg, an extraordinary mystery unfolded. The Enchanted Compass, a magical artifact guiding the town's fate, went missing. Four young puzzle enthusiasts – Emma, Liam, Zoe, and Ethan – decided to embark on a quest to unravel the Puzzle of the Enchanted Compass.

            Following cryptic clues, they ventured into the Puzzlewood Forest, where living jigsaw trees whispered tales of a hidden Puzzle Palace. Navigating through maze-like paths, they uncovered the palace's entrance guarded by the Riddle Sphinx.
            
            To prove their worth, the friends solved a series of intricate riddles, earning passage to the Compass Chamber. There, they encountered the Puzzle Pixie, who revealed that the compass was taken by a mischievous Wind Sprite to the Windy Peaks.
            
            Scaling the peaks, they braved gusty puzzles to reach the Wind Sprite's lair. With a promise to return the compass once her mischief was understood, the sprite surrendered the magical artifact.
            
            Back in Puzzleburg, the Enchanted Compass was restored to its rightful place. The town's fate unfolded in harmony once more, and the friends became local legends, their tale echoing through Puzzleburg as the enchanting Puzzle of the Enchanted Compass. </p>
