        <img src="mystery/starlight heist.jpeg" alt="My Image">
        <p>Under the twinkling night sky in the small town of Starville, a peculiar mystery unfolded. The cherished stars began disappearing one by one, leaving the town in darkness. Four daring friends, Ethan, Lily, Ava, and Oliver, took it upon themselves to solve the Midnight Starlight Heist.

            Armed with glow-in-the-dark maps and curiosity, they ventured into the Whispering Woods, where fireflies whispered tales of a mischievous star thief. The fireflies guided them to the Stardust Cavern, where they uncovered a secret passage leading to the Starlight Observatory.
            
            In the observatory, they encountered Luna, the Moonlight Guardian, who revealed that a playful constellation had decided to explore other galaxies, taking Starville's stars along. Luna offered them a magical telescope to track the mischievous constellation.
            
            Their journey took them through Cosmic Clouds and Galactic Gardens, following the constellation's shimmering trail. As they reached the Starlight Plaza, the constellation, realizing its mistake, returned the stolen stars, transforming the plaza into a celestial dance floor.
            
            The townsfolk gathered to witness the starry spectacle, and the friends became heroes of Starville. The tale of the Midnight Starlight Heist became a cherished story, reminding everyone to appreciate the beauty above and the importance of letting stars shine in the night sky.</p>
